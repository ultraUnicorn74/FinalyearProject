# FinalyearProject
Diabetic retinopathy is caused by an elevated blood glucose level which leads to blood vessels clogging, rupture and leak.
After suffering from diabetes for 25 years, the occurrence of symptoms of DR is typical to 80-100%.
The initial stage of diabetic retinopathy is characterized by the narrowing of the vessel walls and the decrease of blood flow.
In the final stage, the exudates are visible in large clusters and more blood vessels are rapidly forming causing frequent bleeding. 
After this stage, the patient suffers from a complete loss of vision and peeling of the retina.
They often describe seeing floating dark spots and a distorted image caused by blood leaking from damaged vessels.
Symptoms of the disease begin to appear only at later stages, when the patient becomes aware of impaired vision.
Objectives of proposed work:
Prevention of complications in diabetic type-2 patients.
Reduction of morality and disability from diabetic complications.
To Improve in quality of life among diabetic patientsÂ 
Reduction of expenditures for medical care.
